#### [Artificial intelligence: Berkeley Pacman (Python)](https://jonbutler8.github.io/ProjectSummary/pacman)
Object-oriented Python implementations of various Pacman agents following the computer science department of UC Berkeley's specifications. The agent created by my team of three students placed 3rd out of 33 in a class competition, and was chosen for participation in an upcoming for-fun inter-university tournament between RMIT and University of Melbourne.

#### [Appointment Booking System (Java)](https://jonbutler8.github.io/AppointmentBookingSystem)
A GUI appointment booking system developed in Java using JavaFX. Development was performed in a student team following Scum methodology and using Kanban (Trello) to track progress, with me acting as scrum master. Our implementation was chosen as one among a handful that were demoed to other students at the end of the semester. 

#### [Distributed Tram Simulation (Java RMI)](https://jonbutler8.github.io/TramTrackingService)
A distributed system where a client service registers trams to a front-end that are then tracked along a simulated route by replicated tram tracking servers. This was an individual student assignment completed to demonstrate an understanding of distributed computing concepts. Uses Java RMI.
